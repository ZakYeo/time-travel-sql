# Independent review evidence

## Foundation: 7 September 2026

Two fresh read-only thermonuclear reviewers examined the initial SDK and gates.

- First review: require strict checking of tests/tooling and enforce type-only
  ports, private import boundaries, browser isolation and adapter separation.
  Fixed with a test tsconfig, ESLint AST policy, dependency-cruiser rules and
  executable allowed/forbidden fixtures.
- Second review: excluding node_modules erased installed dependency edges and
  direct browser driver imports were not forbidden. Fixed by retaining edges
  without traversing external packages and declaring a browser runtime allowlist.
  Resolved-package fixtures exercise forbidden pg and permitted Preact imports.
- Neither review found a structural or correctness defect in exact source position
  comparison. Semgrep rules and hook wiring were reviewed; no remaining findings.

Validation: `npm run check` includes strict SDK/test compilation, ESLint,
Prettier, dependency-cruiser, five Semgrep rule fixture groups, 28 unit tests and
secret/module-size checks. This is foundation evidence, not release validation.
